# Network Diagnostics & Split Proxy

## 1) Diagnose edge/CDN route failures (504 / x-sid 6980)

Run from local workstation:

```bash
cd /home/dev/Project_Me_All/Project_Me/alirezasafaeisystems
./scripts/network/diagnose-edge-route.sh
```

What it checks:
- `default` path (current proxy/vpn environment)
- `--noproxy '*'` direct path
- Nginx origin access log hit via SSH (`deploy@185.3.124.93`)

Report output:
- `reports/edge-route/<UTC>-edge-route.md`

Interpretation:
- `default=504` + `noproxy!=504` + origin hit = failure before origin (CDN/edge route issue)
- both `504` = origin/app side issue

## 2) Chrome split-proxy launcher (local)

Use when OpenAI must stay on proxy but your own domains should open directly:

```bash
cd /home/dev/Project_Me_All/Project_Me/alirezasafaeisystems
./scripts/network/chrome-split-proxy.sh
```

Optional proxy override:

```bash
PROXY_SERVER="socks5://127.0.0.1:10808" ./scripts/network/chrome-split-proxy.sh
```

## 3) CDN panel actions (for permanent end-user fix)

In CDN panel (Arvan), apply:
1. Validate origin protocol/port from all POPs (not only Iran route).
2. Ensure no country/ASN block is active for edge-to-origin path.
3. Create direct non-CDN fallback host (DNS-only) for emergency/GSC checks.
4. Open support ticket with report file and run id.

## 4) Apply local NO_PROXY policy (recommended)

Keeps OpenAI traffic on proxy while forcing your own domains to go direct for CLI/tools:

```bash
cd /home/dev/Project_Me_All/Project_Me/alirezasafaeisystems
./scripts/network/apply-local-proxy-policy.sh
```

This updates:
- `~/.config/asdev/proxy-policy.env`
- `~/.zshrc`
- `~/.bashrc`

## 5) Install VPS health watch (every 5 minutes)

Installs a root cron job on VPS:
- checks origin endpoints (`127.0.0.1` ports)
- checks edge endpoints (public domains)
- appends logs to `/var/log/asdev-health-watch.log`

```bash
cd /home/dev/Project_Me_All/Project_Me/alirezasafaeisystems
./scripts/network/install-vps-health-watch.sh
```

### Optional: Telegram alerts for failures

```bash
cd /home/dev/Project_Me_All/Project_Me/alirezasafaeisystems
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="xxx" TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID="yyy" ./scripts/network/configure-vps-telegram-alert.sh
```

Settings file on VPS:
- `/etc/default/asdev-health-watch`

Log rotation:
- `/etc/logrotate.d/asdev-health-watch`

## 6) Weekly SLO report (automatic)

Installs a weekly cron (Sunday 23:55 server time) and generates markdown reports:

```bash
cd /home/dev/Project_Me_All/Project_Me/alirezasafaeisystems
./scripts/network/install-vps-weekly-slo-report.sh
```

Outputs on VPS:
- `/var/log/asdev-health-weekly-<timestamp>.md`
- `/var/log/asdev-health-weekly-latest.md`

## 7) One-command monitoring bootstrap

Use this to set/update the full monitoring suite:

```bash
cd /home/dev/Project_Me_All/Project_Me/alirezasafaeisystems
./scripts/network/bootstrap-monitoring-suite.sh
```

## 8) One-command network+SEO ops run (local)

Runs:
1. Edge route diagnosis
2. GSC preflight
3. Chromium network smoke matrix

```bash
cd /home/dev/Project_Me_All/Project_Me/alirezasafaeisystems
./scripts/network/run-network-seo-ops.sh
```

## 9) Live surface audit (DNS / TLS / HTTPS redirect / link checks)

Run this when you need a fast external visibility guard for all 3 live public domains:

```bash
cd /home/dev/Project/alirezasafaeisystems
bash scripts/network/live-surface-audit.sh
```

Default URL list:

- `https://persiantoolbox.ir/`
- `https://persiantoolbox.ir/api/ready`
- `https://alirezasafaeisystems.ir/`
- `https://alirezasafaeisystems.ir/profile`
- `https://alirezasafaeisystems.ir/resume.pdf`
- `https://alirezasafaeisystems.ir/alireza-safaei-resume.pdf`
- `https://audit.alirezasafaeisystems.ir/`
- `https://audit.alirezasafaeisystems.ir/api/ready`

Outputs:
- `docs/runtime/live-surface/live-surface-latest.md`

Env vars:

- `MONITOR_LINKS` (space-separated URL list)
- `VPS_PUBLIC_IPS` (expected public A-record IPs for DNS check)
- `SSH_HOST` (for evidence context only)
- `ENFORCE_HTTP_REDIRECT` (`1`=strict fail, `0`=warn-only)
- `EXPECTED_MAX_CERT_DAYS` (warn threshold before cert expiry)
- `LIVE_SURFACE_REPORT_DIR` (default `docs/runtime/live-surface`)

## Network Smoke release ownership

The checked-in policy in `scripts/lib/network-smoke-target-policy.mjs` separates an observed target result from the ASDEV release verdict. ASDEV checks are blocking. Browser or runner failures that leave ASDEV unmeasured, malformed results, and targets without an explicit policy remain blocking. An ASDEV-originated cross-site navigation failure is also blocking.

Audit and PersianToolbox are independently owned paired products, not runtime dependencies of the ASDEV mother site. Their failures remain `FAIL` in the JSON, Markdown report, workflow summary, and artifact. A PersianToolbox-only CSP failure is classified as `EXTERNAL_PAIRED_TARGET_CSP_FAILURE` and does not by itself fail the ASDEV release verdict. This does not weaken the CSP probe or declare the external target healthy.
